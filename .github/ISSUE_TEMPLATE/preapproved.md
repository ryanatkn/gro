**WAIT STOP!!** Read below:

fuz.dev uses discussions instead of issues for its GitHub repos.
Go to https://github.com/fuzdev/gro/discussions/new/choose
or https://github.com/fuzdev/gro/discussions
and close this. Thank you for contributing!

Why? This keeps all issues actionable for maintainers,
and discussions offer more affordances like voting, polls, Q&A, etc.

**WAIT STOP!!** read above :)
