## what

A Gro `Task` is just an object with a `run` function and some optional metadata.
Gro prefers conventions and code over configuration,
and its task runner leverages the filesystem as the API
and defers composition to the user in regular TypeScript modules.

- Gro automatically discovers [all `*.task.ts` files](../docs/tasks.md)
  in your source directory, so creating a new task
  is as simple as [creating a new file](#define-a-task), no config needed,
  but part of the convention is that Gro expects all source code to be in `src/`
- task definitions are just objects with an async `run` function and some optional properties,
  so composing tasks is explicit in your code, just like any other module
  (but there's also the helper `invoke_task`: see more below)
- on the command line, tasks replace the concept of commands,
  so running them is as simple as `gro <task>`,
  and in code the task object's `run` function has access to CLI args;
  to view [the available tasks](https://github.com/feltjs/gro/blob/main/src/lib/docs/tasks.md)
  run `gro` with no arguments
- tasks optionally use [zod](https://github.com/colinhacks/zod) schemas
  for `args` types, runtime parsing with helpful validation errors,
  and automatic help output, with DRY co-located definitions
- it's easy to hook into or override any of Gro's builtin tasks,
  like [`gro test`](../test.task.ts) and [`gro gen`](../gen.task.ts)
  (tasks are copy-paste friendly! just update the imports)
- the task execution environment is filesystem agnostic by default; `run` receives a
  [`TaskContext` argument](#user-content-types-task-and-taskcontext) with an `fs` property
- the `TaskContext` provides a rich baseline context object
  for both development/build tasks and one-off script authoring/execution;
  it attempts to be portable and extensibile, but there's a _lot_ of room for improvement
- it's fast because it imports only the modules that your chosen tasks need

The task runner's purpose is to provide an ergonomic interface
between the CLI, build tools, and app code.
As a developer, it's nice to be able to reuse TypeScript modules in every context.

## usage

### show all available tasks

```bash
# This looks through `src/` in both the current working directory
# and Gro's source for all files matching `*.task.ts` and logs them out.
$ gro
```

> notice that Gro is hardcoded to expect all tasks to be in `src/` --
> it would be nice to loosen this up, but the API isn't obvious to me right now

### show tasks in a directory

```bash
# Logs all `*.task.ts` files in `src/lib/some/dir` and `gro/src/lib/some/dir`.
# If no tasks are found, it displays an error.
$ gro some/dir
```

> To learn more about the Gro CLI path conventions,
> see [the `input_paths` comments](../util/input_path.ts)

### run a task

```bash
# This runs `src/lib/some/file.task.ts`,
# or if it doesn't exist, `gro/src/lib/some/file.task.ts`.
# If neither exists, it displays an error.
$ gro some/file arg1 arg2 --arg3 example

# This runs `gro/src/lib/some/file.task.ts` directly
# without checking the current working directory,
# and displays an error if it doesn't exist.
$ gro gro/some/file
```

### define a task

```ts
// src/lib/some/file.task.ts
import type {Task} from '@feltjs/gro';

export const task: Task = {
	run: async ({log, args}) => {
		log.info('CLI args', args); // => {_: ['arg1', 'arg2'], arg3: 'example'}
		await whatever();
	},
};
```

The minimum:

```ts
// src/lib/some/minimal.task.ts
export const task = {
	run: () => console.log('a minimal example'),
};
```

Minimum with [`Args`](#task-args):

```ts
// src/lib/some/withargs.task.ts
import type {Task} from '@feltjs/gro';
import {z} from 'zod';

export const Args = z
	.object({
		arg: z.number({description: 'example number arg'}).default(2),
	})
	.strict();
export type Args = z.infer<typeof Args>;

export const task: Task = {
	Args,
	run: async ({args}) => {
		args.arg; // `number` that defaults to `2`
	},
};
```

### task directories

As a convenience, Gro interprets `src/lib/some/taskname/taskname.task.ts`
the same as `src/lib/some/taskname.task.ts`,
so instead of running `gro some/taskname/taskname` you simply run `gro some/taskname`.
This is useful because tasks may have associated files (see the args docs below),
and putting them into a directory together can help make projects easier to navigate.

### type `Task`

```ts
import type {Task} from '@feltjs/gro';

export interface Task<
	TArgs = Args, // same as `z.infer<typeof Args>`
	TArgsSchema extends z.ZodType<any, z.ZodTypeDef, any> = z.ZodType<any, z.ZodTypeDef, any>,
> {
	run: (ctx: TaskContext<TArgs>) => Promise<unknown>;
	summary?: string;
	Args?: TArgsSchema;
}
```

### type `TaskContext`

```ts
import type {TaskContext} from '@feltjs/gro';

export interface TaskContext<TArgs = object> {
	config: GroConfig;
	log: Logger;
	args: TArgs;
	invoke_task: (task_name: string, args?: object) => Promise<void>;
}
```

### run a task inside another task with `invoke_task`

Because Gro tasks are just functions,
you can directly import them from within other tasks and run them.
However, we recommend using the `invoke_task` helper
for its ergonomics and automatic logging and diagnostics.

The `invoke_task` helper uses Gro's task resolution rules
to allow user code to override builtin tasks.
For example, Gro's `check.task.ts` calls `invoke_task('test')`
so that it calls your `src/test.task.ts` if it exists
and falls back to `gro/src/test.task.ts` if not.

It's less important to use `invoke_task` over explicit imports in user code
because you don't need to rely on the task override rules to get desired behavior,
but the logging and diagnostics it provides are nice to have.

```bash
gro some/file
```

```ts
// src/lib/some/file.task.ts
import type {Task} from '@feltjs/gro';

export const task: Task = {
	run: async ({args, invoke_task}) => {
		// runs `src/lib/some/file.task.ts`, automatically forwarding `args`
		await invoke_task('some/file');
		// as documented above, the following is similar but lacks nice features:
		// await (await import('./some/file.task.js')).run(ctx);

		// runs `src/other/file.task.ts` and falls back to `gro/src/other/file.task.ts`,
		// forwarding both custom args and a different event emitter (warning: spaghetti)
		await invoke_task(
			'other/file',
			{...args, optionally: 'extended'},
			optionalEventEmitterForSubtree,
			optionalDevFlagForSubtree,
			optionalFsForSubtree,
		);

		// runs `gro/src/other/file.task.ts` directly, bypassing any local version
		await invoke_task('gro/other/file');
	},
};
```

### hook into one of [Gro's builtin tasks](../docs/tasks.md)

```bash
# This normally loads Gro's version of the test task at `gro/src/test.task.ts`,
# but projects can define `src/test.task.ts` to extend or replace it.
$ gro test
```

```ts
// src/test.task.ts
import type {Task} from '@feltjs/gro';

export const task: Task = {
	run: async ({args, invoke_task}) => {
		await doSomethingFirst();
		// As discussed in the `invoke_task` section above,
		// it's possible to `import {task as groBuiltinTestTask} from '@feltjs/gro/test.task.js'`
		// and then call `groBuiltinTestTask.run` directly,
		// but that loses some important benefits.
		// Still, the task is available to import if you want it for any reason!
		await invoke_task('gro/test', {...args, optionally: 'extended'}, newEventEmitterForSubtree);
		await emailEveryoneWithTestResults();
	},
};
```

Note that when hooking into [Gro's builtin tasks](../docs/tasks.md),
like `test.task.ts` above, you don't have to call its version.
You can copy/paste an existing task and customize it,
rewrite a task from scratch, compose them together, or whatever is needed for each project.

### task `Args`

The **`Args` property** of each `Task` (not the task context **`args` param** described above!)
is an optional [zod](https://github.com/colinhacks/zod) schema.
Using zod has some benefits:

- automatically print helpful text on the CLI with `gro` and `gro taskname --help`
- automated args parsing/validation using the schema with initialized defaults
- type safety using args in tasks
- concise source of truth

```ts
// src/dosomething.task.ts
import type {Task} from '@feltjs/gro';
import type {z} from 'zod';

export const Args = z
	.object({
		_: z.array(z.string(), {description: 'rest args'}).default([]),
		yepyep: z.string({description: 'helpful info'}).default('ya'),
		okcool: z.number({description: 'that prints to the CLI'}).default(1234),
		maybee: z.boolean({description: 'and optional args work too'}),
	})
	.strict();
export type Args = z.infer<typeof Args>;

export const task: Task<Args> = {
	Args,
	run: async ({args}) => {
		args._; // string[]
		args.yepyep; // string
		args.okcool; // number
		args.maybee; // boolean | undefined
	},
};
```

Running `gro dosomething --help` prints the schema information in a friendly format.

### task args forwarding

Some builtin Gro tasks call external commands like
[`svelte-kit`](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit),
[`vite`](https://github.com/vitejs/vite),
[`uvu`](https://github.com/lukeed/uvu),
[`tsc`](https://github.com/microsoft/typescript),
and [`prettier`](https://github.com/prettier/prettier).
Gro supports generic agnostic args forwarding to these tasks via the `--` pattern:
for example, to forward args to `svelte-kit` and `uvu`, no matter which task invokes them,
use `gro taskname --taskname-arg -- uvu --arg1 neat --arg2 22 -- svelte-kit --arg3`.

Any number of sections separated by `--` may be defined, and the first arg
that appears after each `--` is assumed to be the CLI command.
If `gro taskname` or its invoked tasks don't call `uvu` or `svelte-kit`,
the `--` args will be ignored.

There's one special case for task args forwarding: running Gro tasks.
If `gro` is the command following a `--`, e.g. the second `gro` of
`gro taskname -- gro taskname2 --a --b`,
then `--a` and `--b` will be forwarded to `taskname2`.
Forwarded args to Gro tasks override direct args, including args to `invoke_task`,
so `gro taskname --a 1 -- gro taskname --a 2` will invoke `taskname` with `{a: 2}`.

### throwing errors

If a task encounters an error, normally it should throw rather than exiting the process.
This defers control to the caller, like your own parent tasks.

Often, errors that tasks encounter do not need a stack trace,
and we don't want the added noise to be logged.
To suppress logging the stack trace for an error,
throw a `TaskError`.

```ts
import {Task, TaskError} from '@feltjs/gro';

export const task: Task = {
	run: async () => {
		if (someErrorCondition) {
			throw new TaskError('We hit a known error - ignore the stack trace!');
		}
	},
};
```

## why?

Gro usage on the command line (`gro <taskOrDirectory> [...flags]`)
looks a lot like using `node`.
What makes Gro different?

- The `*.task.ts` file name convention signals to Gro that your application
  contains task modules that conform to some interface.
  This allows them to be discoverable by convention,
  so running `gro` displays them all without any config, and it puts generic handles on them,
  enabling various verbs (e.g. `run`) and structured metadata (e.g. `summary`).
- Tasks aren't just a script, they can be inspected, composed, and manipulated in code.
  Task modules do not have any side effects when imported,
  while Node scripts just execute when imported -
  their primary purpose is to cause side effects.
  This is useful in many cases - for example `gro taskname --help`
  inspects the args schema and other metadata to print help to the console,
  and `gro` prints the `summary` property of each task it finds.
  There's lots more to explore here, like task composition
  and improved DX with new capabilities.
- Tasks support CLI args that are validated and typesafe
  via colocated Zod schemas with minimal boilerplate.
- Module resolution differs:
  - When a task name is given to Gro,
    it first searches `src/lib/` in the current working directory and
    falls back to searching the Gro directory.
    This allows your code and CLI commands to use Gro's builtin tasks
    or override or extend them without changing how you invoke them.
    Gro reserves no special behavior for its own commands -
    `gro test`, `gro gen`, and all the rest are just tasks that all follow the same rules.
    (see its task at [`src/test.task.ts`](../test.task.ts)).
  - When a directory is given to Gro,
    it prints all of the tasks found inside it,
    both relative to the current working directory and Gro's directory.
    So when you run `gro` by itself,
    it prints all tasks available both in your project and Gro.
  - The trailing `.task.ts` in the file path provided to `gro` is optional,
    so for example, `gro foo/bar` is the same as `gro foo/bar.task.ts`, a nice convenience.
