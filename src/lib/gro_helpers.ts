/**
 * Resolves a path to an internal Gro file.
 * Prefers any local installation of Gro and falls back to the current CLI context.
 *
 * Uses heuristics to find `path`, so may fail in some rare corner cases.
 * Currently looks for `gro.js` as a sibling to the `path` arg for detection.
 * If this fails for your usecases, rename `gro.js` or open an issue/PR!
 *
 * Used by the CLI and `gro run`.
 *
 * case 1:
 *
 * We're in a directory that has a local installation of Gro at `node_modules/.bin/gro`.
 * Use this local version instead of the global.
 *
 * case 2:
 *
 * We're running Gro inside the Gro repo itself.
 *
 * In this case, we use the build directory instead of dist.
 * There's a paradox here for using Gro inside itself -
 * ideally we use the dist directory because that's what's shipped,
 * but the build directory has all of the tests,
 * and loading two instances of its modules causes problems
 * like `instanceof` checks failing.
 * For now we'll just run from build and see if it causes any problems.
 * There's probably a better design in here somewhere.
 *
 * case 3:
 *
 * Fall back to invoking Gro from wherever the CLI is being executed.
 * When using the global CLI, this uses the global Gro installation.
