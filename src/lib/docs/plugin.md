# plugin

During the [`gro dev`](dev.md) and [`gro build`](build.md) tasks,
Gro uses `Plugin`s to support custom usecases outside of the normal build pipeline.

In this early implementation of plugins in Gro,
plugins run serially, in the order they are returned from `plugin` in the `gro.config.ts`.
Each step of Gro's build processes - `gro dev` for development and `gro build` for production -
runs a method of each plugin, batched together as `setup -> adapt -> teardown`,
with some behavioral inconsistencies:

- `adapt` only runs during production aka `gro build`
- `teardown` does not run for `gro dev` in the default `watch` mode,
  but it does run with `gro dev --no-watch`
- there should probably be a finalization step that runs `teardown` on uncaught exceptions

The API needs to be improved for more advanced usecases,
currently it offers little flexibility -
we'll follow the Vite/SvelteKit APIs probably. (`pre` etc)
Maybe let you map the array of each method batch. (is that possible with those?)

Gro's builtin plugins:

- [`@grogarden/gro_plugin_server`](../gro_plugin_server.ts)
- [`@grogarden/gro_plugin_library`](../gro_plugin_library.ts)
- [`@grogarden/gro_plugin_sveltekit_frontend`](../gro_plugin_sveltekit_frontend.ts)
- [`@grogarden/gro_plugin_gen`](../gro_plugin_gen.ts)
  (currently disabled, will be replaced with an esbuild plugin)

Also see [`config.plugin` in the config docs](config.md#plugin)
and usage in [the default config](../gro.config.default.ts).
The default config detects which plugins are included by inspecting the current project.

The implementation is at [`src/lib/plugin.ts`](../plugin.ts) with more details.

```ts
export interface Plugin<TPluginContext extends PluginContext = PluginContext> {
	name: string;
	setup?: (ctx: TPluginContext) => void | Promise<void>;
	adapt?: (ctx: TPluginContext) => void | Promise<void>;
	teardown?: (ctx: TPluginContext) => void | Promise<void>;
}

export interface PluginContext<TArgs = object> extends TaskContext<TArgs> {
	dev: boolean;
	watch: boolean;
}
```

The `adapt` step only runs for production during `gro build`, taking after SvelteKit adapters.
